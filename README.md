#  To-Do List with Google Tasks Integration

A desktop-based To-Do List application built using **PyQt5** that helps you manage tasks locally and sync them with **Google Tasks**. It features priority tagging, event time scheduling, dark mode, and seamless integration with the Google Tasks API.

##  Features

- Add, delete, and mark tasks as done 
- Assign **priority levels** (High, Medium, Low) with colored indicators 
- Schedule tasks using a date-time input 
- Enable **Dark Mode** for a comfortable viewing experience 
- Sync tasks with **Google Tasks** using OAuth2 
- Local task storage using **SQLite** for offline access
